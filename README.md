My  blog site: [link](https://anthlis.github.io)

This is a static website hosted on GitHub. The page is based on the following tools:

* [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), the microframework used for building sites.
* [Flask-Flatpages](https://flask-flatpages.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/), this extension can convert Markdown documents into HTML pages. I'm writing my blog posts in Markdown, a far more convenient format than HTML.
* [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/), the extension that generates static pages by analyzing the web application's views (functions responsible for producing a page, or more technically, a HTTP response for a given URL).
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) ([blog template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/blog/))
* [Python Markdown Extension](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/) (including [python-markdown-math](https://github.com/mitya57/python-markdown-math))

This blog is inspired by this awesome [tutorial](https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/).
